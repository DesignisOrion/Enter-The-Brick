# Enter The Brick

### About 
This program allows you to play with a 3D brick inspired from Nintendo's famous "Super Mario Brothers" game. 

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Three.JS

### What I learned:

In this project I was able to explore the library of Three.js. Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. The goal was to create a skybox that will allow the cube to be moved around in all directions within the screen fixed. (If that makes sense)
Learning Skybox allowed me to understand how to apply multiple "material" sides of the cube in which I used a mario brick png.

For this project I was able to learn the following: 

- working with controls using orbitcontrols.js
- working with loading objects with objectloader.js
- working with GTLF files using GLTFLoader.js
